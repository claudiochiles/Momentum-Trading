# Momentum-Trading

This file shows how to decide what stocks to invest in using a momentum trading strategy. In this case the stock of the IPSA (the chilean index of top stocks)
was chosen. 

The second part (once you invest and buy specific stock using the model) that is commented shows the performance 
in terms of returns, volatility and moving averages of those chosen stocks. It then provides the condition necessary in order to sell
the stock at the correct time, once again using the momentum strategy
